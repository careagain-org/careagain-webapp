# Community page

## Exploring the Community

The Community section is divided into three main tabs, each designed to help you connect, collaborate, and contribute:

1. **Map:**
   View the community map showing all registered organizations on the platform.
   This feature helps you:

   - Discover potential collaborators near you

   - Join ongoing projects in your area

   - Request support as a hospital

   - Connect with local manufacturers and transport providers

2. **Organizations:**
   Easily search for organizations by name or topic using the search bar—just type your query and press Enter.

   Click on any organization to view:

   - Detailed information about its activities

   - Potential collaboration opportunities

   - Ways to connect with its members (if available)

3. **Users:**
   Search for users by name or username using the search bar—type your query and press Enter.
   Clicking on a user’s name will take you to their profile page, where you can learn more about their contributions and activity.

## Add / Manage your organization

At the top of the page, next to the title, you’ll find two buttons:

- **Add New Organization** – Submit your organization to be listed in the community (requires login)

- **Manage Your Organization** – Go to your profile to update your organization's information. If you're not logged in, you’ll be redirected to the login page.
