# Projects page

## Explore Open-Source Projects

The Projects page showcases all open-source projects registered on the platform.
You can easily search for projects by name, keyword, or topic using the search bar—just type your query and press **Enter**. You can navigate to each of the projects pages by clicking in the project.

To explore a project in more detail, simply click on it to navigate to its dedicated page.

On each project page, you can:

- View detailed information about the project

- Download available resources (if logged in)

- Connect with the project owner (if available)

## Add / Manage your projects

At the top of the page, next to the title, you’ll find two buttons:

- **Create New Project** – Opens a project submission form (available only when logged in)

- **Manage Your Projects** – Takes you to your profile page where you can manage your submitted projects. If you're not logged in, you'll be redirected to the login page.
