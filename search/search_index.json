Its core mission is to share key knowledge and resources to enhance healthcare delivery, promoting more equitable and sustainable access to essential medical equipment.</p> <p>A central pillar of CareAgain is the sharing of knowledge through Open Source Medical Devices. This initiative allows anyone\u2014regardless of location or resources\u2014to access the designs, schematics, and technical specifications of medical equipment. By enabling local production, it significantly reduces the costs associated with acquiring medical technology.</p> <p>In addition, CareAgain actively fosters a community committed to the development and improvement of open medical technologies. By connecting developers, engineers, healthcare professionals, and local communities, the platform encourages collaboration and the exchange of innovative ideas and solutions that can be applied in diverse contexts.</p> <p>Together, CareAgain serves as a catalyst for transforming access to and use of medical technology, building a collaborative and sustainable ecosystem that supports global health improvement\u2014especially in resource-limited settings.</p>"},{"location":"#future-versions","title":"\ud83d\udccd Future versions","text":"<p>Future features to be included in the future:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Facilitation of medical equipment donations/relocations, allowing devices and resources to be donated and distributed to areas where they are most needed.
